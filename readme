This repository contains R code and data to apply dasymetric refinement of 2018 population at regional NUTS3 level to model 2018 population and municipality (LAU) level - for Denmark and Finland respectively. 

The weighting folder contains R code to calculate input weights for respectively Denmark and Finland by mapping Corine land cover 2018 classes to EU census grid 2021 to calculate average per-CORINE-class population density-based weights.  
The dasymetric mapping folder contains the code to use the input weights and input data to carry out the dasymetric refinement. Resulting maps are created in R with tmap.
